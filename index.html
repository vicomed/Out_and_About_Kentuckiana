					<h2>Out and About Kentuckiana, Inc.</h2>
					<p>We strive to fight the social isolation that can often come with a disability. We believe that Kentuckiana has the capacity to be enhanced through the sharing of unique gifts, talents and contributions of all its members. A feeling of belonging, kinship with others and opportunities to participate in community life, maximizes health of mind, body and spirit. 

					Out and About Kentuckiana, Inc provides people with disabilities the means to participate in community activities such as: movies, concerts, art classes, sporting events, zoo, car show and so forth. We are also currently raising funds for a trishaw to offer rides to seniors and people with disabilities all over Louisville. Everyone has a right to feel the wind in their hair and to get out and enjoy the community! Help fight isolation by improving public health and social inclusion while bringing happiness to others.</p>
