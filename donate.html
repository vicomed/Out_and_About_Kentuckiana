				<p>Thank you for considering a donation to Out and About Kentuckiana, Inc. With your generosity, you are providing experiences and opportunities to individuals who otherwise would go without. Life is about seeing the world around you, learning from it and engaging with others in the community. Community Integration and inclusion are important if we are to fight the isolation and loneliness that often comes along with a disability. Your donation, no matter how small, will help us enable someone to get Out and About! Help someone be able to enjoy a movie, zoo, concert, sporting event or any number of leisure activities in our community.</p>
