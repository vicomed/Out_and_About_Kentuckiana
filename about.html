			<h1>OUR VISION</h1>
			<h2>Our vision is to be part of a DIVERSE world, in which everyone has the opportunity to live a fully inclusive life in their chosen community.</h2>
			<p>Out and About Kentuckiana, Inc is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit that's goal is to facilitate community inclusion and integration. A  group of area rehab specialists and social service providers saw that the people they served seldom enjoyed activities in the community that most of us take for granted. It is important for all people to feel a sense of inclusion.</p>
			<ul id=inclusion>

				<li>Inclusion treasures diversity and builds community.</li>
				<li>Inclusion is about ALL of US.</li>
				<li>Inclusion is NOT just a “disability issue”.</li>

				<li>Inclusion is age-friendly.</li>
